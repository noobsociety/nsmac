# Completion.verification — Verification semantics reference

Standalone reference for `Completion.verification` sub-state semantics. Loaded by `show-policy.md`, `seal-verification.md`, and any contributor needing a non-route description of the reviewer verification loop.

## Sub-states

`Completion` splits into two ordered sub-states for reviewer-backed collabs:

| Sub-state | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Completion.execution` | `/collab run plan` execution for all assigned roles, resulting in `execution.<role>` registry entries. |
| `Completion.verification` | Assigned participants run `/collab participant verify` (if configured); reviewer then issues `/collab seal verification` and evaluates whether discussion goals were met. |

Execution precedes verification. Close is blocked until a current non-stale `verificationSeal` exists and the reviewer has emitted a `verdict` with `outcome == success`.

## verification.subState

Within `Completion.verification`, three ordered sub-states apply for reviewer-backed collabs:

| Sub-state | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `verification.participant` | Assigned participants run `/collab participant verify`; per-role three-turn sequence (audit → remediation → final-audit). Precedes `verification.seal`. |
| `verification.seal` | Reviewer issues `/collab seal verification`; mechanical execution-truth check. Existing seal contract unchanged. |
| `verification.assessment` | Reviewer evaluates whether discussion goals were met and emits a `verdict`. |

`verification.participant` precedes `verification.seal`, which precedes `verification.assessment`. Assessment opens after a successful seal. Assessment also re-opens when the seal becomes stale or a cap-exit is recorded, which invalidates the prior seal. Assessment is budget-exempt when a cap-exit trigger opened it.

### Per-role stage: `verification.participants[role].stage`

Within `verification.participant`, each assigned role's progress is tracked independently under `verification.participants[role].stage`:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `audit` | Turn 1 is active; the role's executed writeScope is being inspected. |
| `remediation` | Turn 2 is active; findings from audit are being resolved. |
| `final-audit` | Turn 3 is active; the scope is being re-inspected against Turn 1 criteria. |
| `completed` | All three turns passed; this role's participant verification is done. |
| `failed` | Final-audit found unresolved issues; the sequence ended with failures. |

`verification.participants[role].stage` is absent when participant verification is not configured or the role has not yet begun its sequence. `verification.subState` remains `"participant"` across all roles during this sub-state; per-turn labels are stored per-role, not as additional global sub-state transitions.

### Assessment verdict

The reviewer emits a verdict during `verification.assessment`:

```
verdict: { outcome, restoreTarget?, restoreReason?, evidence?, failureCategory? }
```

- `outcome`: `success | incomplete | failed`. On `success`, helper closes and summarizes. On `incomplete` or `failed`, the helper emits the restore command as a `NEXT:` advisory; moderator runs `/collab reopen <restoreTarget>` to perform the full phase reset. The helper does not auto-execute the restore.
- `evidence`: read-only anchors only — transcript ids, registry revision, committed paths, execution entry ids. The reviewer does not write implementation steps, command output, or replacement content.
- `restoreTarget`: required when `outcome != success`; must be ≤ current phase in lifecycle order; restricted to registered phases with route support.
- `restoreReason`: required when `outcome != success`; explains the causal determination.
- `failureCategory`: optional causal label; does not require writing remediation.

Assessment must emit even when no actionable cause is identifiable: `nullResult: true` with a one-line justification. Silent non-emission is not permitted.

> **Drift (collab #8):** Authorship-bias disclosure (§4.7, verificationSeal.observedRevision 251, verdict revision 253) — see the commit introducing this note.

> **Drift (collab #10):** `assessment_next_line` (was at `registry.py:4097–4101`) previously emitted `NEXT: Moderator should run /collab set active-phase {target} --force.` for non-success verdicts — the wrong primitive. This document reflects the corrected target behavior (`/collab reopen <restoreTarget>`); the implementation fix landed in collab #10's platform-engineer scope.

## Round definition

A verification round is a paired-event unit: one reviewer event plus any executor patch events within the same `Completion.verification` cycle. Rounds are registry-countable; `tools/collab/registry.py` increments the count on each paired event. The count is not derived from transcript parsing.

**Zero-round rule:** A seal over zero verification rounds is a hard ABORT. At least one complete reviewer-executor paired event must be recorded before the seal is accepted. There is no advisory or warning path for the zero-round case.

## Seal object

`verificationSeal` is written atomically to the registry by `seal-render`:

```
verificationSeal = {
  observedRevision: integer,
  executionEntries: object[],
  validationScopes: string[],
  touchedPaths:    string[],
  sealedAt:        ISO-8601,
  sealedBy:        string
}
```

The `observedRevision` binds the seal to the registry state at seal time. Any subsequent change to the fields covered by the seal triggers staleness.

## Stale-seal triggers

Each trigger is helper-enforced with a paired shell test asserting invalidation:

| Trigger | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Execution rewrite via `/collab rewrite execution` | `rewrite-execution` helper path invalidates seal |
| Transcript repair touching Completion execution evidence | Repair helper path invalidates seal |
| Out-of-scope patch applied outside declared `writeScope` | `execute-spawn` rejection or explicit helper hook |

A stale seal blocks close. The seal must be re-issued after any stale trigger fires.

## Cap and cap-exit options

A round cap is set at collab initialization (default: 3). When the cap fires, the reviewer must choose one registered cap-exit action recorded on the seal; no further rounds are accepted after a cap exit is recorded.

The participant-verification attempt budget is bound to the active Handoff `writeScope` hash. A reopen via `reopen-handoff` that introduces a different `writeScope` signature opens a new attempt budget for participant verification. A reopen that preserves the same `writeScope` signature consumes budget against the same counter.

| Cap-exit action | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| `reopen-action-plan` | Transitions the collab to `Action Plan` phase |
| `reopen-handoff` | Transitions the collab to `Handoff` phase |
| `archive` | Closes with an accepted-risk summary |
| `follow-up-collab` | Ends the verification loop and opens a new linked collab for unresolved findings; `seal-render` emits structured `NEXT:` guidance with `restoreReason`, open `evidence` anchors, and `failureCategory`. |

The cap-exit action is passed to `seal-render` as `--cap-exit <action>`. The reviewer may also declare a cap exit before the cap fires when they choose to end the loop early.

## writeScope reopen advisory

When the reviewer discovers during `Completion.verification` that required fixes are outside the executed `writeScope`, the only registered exit is `/collab seal verification --cap-exit reopen-handoff`. This transition reopens `Handoff` for a revised scope declaration; informal scope widening is not permitted.

The boundary source is `handoff.roles.<role>.writeScope` in the registry.

## Reviewer obligation

Only the `reviewerRole` participant may author the seal. Non-reviewer roles must not issue `/collab seal verification`. The reviewer's terminal obligation for reviewer-backed collabs is issuing the seal; the reviewer does not run the full test suite as part of verification.

## Auto-close

For reviewer-backed collabs, auto-close from `/collab run plan` alone is removed. Close fires only when all assigned `execution.<role>` entries are `completed` AND a current non-stale `verificationSeal` exists. Both conditions must hold simultaneously.
